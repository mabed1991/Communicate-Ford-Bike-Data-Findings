## Communicate-Ford-Bike-Data-Findings

This project is divided into two major parts:

- In the first part, I conducted an exploratory data analysis on a dataset Ford GoBike System Data. I used Python data science and data visualization libraries to explore the dataset’s variables and understand the data’s structure, oddities, patterns and relationships. The analysis in this part is structured, going from simple univariate relationships up through multivariate relationships.

- In the second part, I took my main findings from my exploration and conveyed them to others through an explanatory analysis. To this end, I created a slide deck that leverages polished, explanatory visualizations to communicate my results.
